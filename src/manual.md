## Introduction

The **DeepSec** prover is a verification tool for *cryptographic protocols*.
It allows the verification of security properties (expressed as *trace equivalence*) of protocols described in the applied pi calculus.
The tool operates in the so-called "*bounded number of sessions*" model:
while it only allows to specify a fixed number of participants and sessions, termination is always guaranteed (though computational resources may be exhausted in practice if the model is too large).



### Scope of this manual

This manual provides a "hands-on" introduction on how to use the tool.
It provides intuitive explanations of the language and the properties it permits to verify.
It also explains the different options and provides a reference guide for the precise syntax.
It however does *not* give formal semantics nor explains the underlying algorithms.
The theory underlying **DeepSec** is yet described in [@CKR-sp18] and [@CKR-ccs19].
Some of the implementation choices are also discussed in a tool paper [@CKR-cav18].
