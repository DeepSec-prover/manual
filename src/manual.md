## Introduction

The **deepsec** prover is a verification tool for cryptographic protocols. It allows the verification of security properties (expressed as a trace equivalence) of protocols described in the applied pi calculus. The tool operates in the so-called "bounded number of sessions" model: while it only allows to specify a fixed number of participants and sessions, termination is always guaranteed (though computational ressources may be exhausted if the model is too large).





### Scope of this manual

This manual provides a "hands-on" introduction on how to use the tool. It will provide intuitive explanations of the language and the properties. It will also explain the different options and prov ide a reference guide for the precise syntax. It will however *not* give formal semantics nor explain the underlying algorithms.  The theory underlying **deepsec** is described in [@CKR-sp18] and [@CKR-ccs19]. Some of the implementation choices are also discussed in a tool paper [@CKR-cav18].
